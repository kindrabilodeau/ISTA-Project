# **Kindra Bilodeau**
## Project step 1
### Date: January 12, 2019

#### Introduction:
 My name is Kindra Bilodeau, this is an introduction to my project ideas. I will be walking through three project ideas. Those ideas will consist of what type it is, the intension that it will be designed for and a brief description of how to do that.
#### Strategy Game:
The first project idea that caught my eye was a strategy game. The first thing that came to mind was a memory game. You click on the tile, try to remember exactly where it was and then click on another tile hoping to find its mate. The idea of trying to figure out to make that is intriguing.
#### Online Store:
 The second project idea would be for a store. I would make a yarn store. That would consist of the products that they carry and sell. Along with the user registration and their payment information. As well the ability to put things in a cart and search for product. The example I found would be like an Etsy store.
#### Organization System:
The third and final project idea is for an organization system. I would like to create one for a pet shelter. It would contain new pet registrations coming in covering basic information. It would have information about where the current pets are located within the shelter. Then finally adoption forms for each pet, containing information about behavior and maybe a photo of each one.
#### Conclusion:
 Those are the three that I would really enjoy doing. Not only learning the behind the scenes on how they work but I personally enjoy all three topics. No matter the choice of type of project, it will tough but fun.
