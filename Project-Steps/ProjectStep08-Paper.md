## Kindra Bilodeau
#### Project Step 8

#### Intro
- My name is Kindra Bilodeau.

#### Project
##### Broken into the different data groups:
-  My project a program for an animal shelter. A program that will include everything needed for a shelter. It will consist mostly of the data. There are the animals, and all the information that pertains to them. Their breed, age, gender, sex. As well the medical information. Things like if they have any diagnosed conditions and the medication required for that. And other things like if they have been fostered and adopted and by who.
There is the information pertaining to the employees. Their hire date, address, contact info and so on. And the Clients, their name, address, and payment info.
- The shelter would also offer various services. Such as Boarding, baths, etc.. that the employees would be responsible for and clients can purchase. then there would be a section that a client can pay for all of these things. That's where the payment information comes into play. A client could also make donations to the shelter if they wish.
- The shelter would also include a "Calendar" that the employees would manage. It would have dates of different events. Adoption day or a shelter 5k to raise money, the clients would be able to register to attend or make donations.
- There will also be a section on fostering and adopting. A client can foster or adopt an animal. If they foster, they will assigned an employees who will track the progress of the animal and client. If they adopt there will be a record kept on file, And an event put on the calendar, or newsletter.
#### Finally
- This has already started to grow as a project. The data keeps growing on what would need to be included. As each week goes on and I continue learning new things, there is more added to this project. Which is what I like about this choice is, it can be as simple or complicated as I want. And it allows for expansion as I continue learning new topics and how to implement different things.
