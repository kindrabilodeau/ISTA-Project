#### Project Step 2
--Date: January 21, 2019

My name is Kindra Bilodeau, I have chosen to do an Organization System for an animal shelter. I chose this topic because I love animals. My goals by the end of this project, I want to have a decent understanding of how databases work and how to create a program that is actually functional. I think that this a great way to learn how to do both.

The project data will consist of all information that an animal shelter would use. Data relating to the animals being checked into the shelter, type of animal, name, age, breed, color, vaccines, etc. Then where they are located at within the shelter, food ratio, behavior characteristics, health concerns. Then finally an adoption section that uses the information from the first two sections.

The user interface would a graphical one. The personal working in the shelter would be able to input information for new pets and update information for ones that are already there. While a client would be able to look through the section of animals available for adaption. They can select their preferences via the interface and maybe even look at pictures.

The logic behind how to implement this is something I will need to learn. It would consists of several relational databases, and a way to access those databases. But I am still learning and will continue to learn along the way, and when the time comes will know how to apply it.

This first step in my plan is make charts of the databases and how they will work together. Then to learn about the graphical interfaces and how to connect that to all of the databases. Then go several rounds of testing to ensure that they work together. I hoping that by the end of this project I will have a fully functional program.
